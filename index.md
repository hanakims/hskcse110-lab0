Welcome to my ***great*** user page, where I 
> tell you about my user.

# About me
I'm currently at UC San Diego studying for a BS in Computer Science. I'm especially interested in learning about human-computer interaction and, at my core, am motivated by a drive to help others and serve the public.

# My work
Currently, I direct most of my energy into my two clubs that I am very passionate about: Triton Software Engineers, and Engineers4Exporation. In Triton Software Engineers, I work with the Your Clear Way team by working with a non-profit to develop an app to motivate home-owners to make more environmentally-conscious decisions. In Engineers4Exporation, I work with the Mangrove Monitoring team in developing an ML based mangrove tree labeling tool that researchers use. In my free time, I also help out with front-end work for the startup ThisAble, a website dedicated to connecting disabled students to disabled mentors in the workplace for guidance in their futures.
